•	Problem statement
(Determination of Dynamic Performance Characteristics of Higher Order Systems)

•	Theory\\
System dynamics is an important area of study in widespread engineering applications such as vibrations, electric circuits, and control systems. Dynamic performance characteristics of a system describe how the system responds to a varying input. The most useful mathematical model for representing system behaviour is the ordinary linear differential equation with constant coefficients. Accordingly, the relationship between system input x(t) and system output y(t) may be written in the following form.

 where a and b are constants dependent on system physical parameters. The corresponding transfer function of the system is

 where s is the Laplace operator. Fig. 1 shows a block diagram of the system with input x(t) and output y(t).

*4.Experiment 4*\\

•	Problem statement
(Signal Conditioning Circuit for RTD (Resistance Temperature Detector))




•	Theory\\

An RTD (resistance temperature detector) is a temperature detector based upon a variation in electric resistance. The commonest metal for this application is platinum. RTDs rely on the positive temperature coefficient for a conductor’s resistance. In a conductor, the number of electrons available to conduct electricity does not significantly change with temperature. But when the temperature increases, the vibration of atoms around their equilibrium positions increase in amplitude. This result in a greater dispersion of electrons, which reduces their average speed. Hence, the resistance increases when the temperature rises. 
 
         
    The relationship between temperature and resistance of RTD is given by-
 
        [[EIL pics/pic 4.png]]                      
 
 
where, 
             R             is resistance at    T
 
       R0  is resistance at 0oC, and alpha is temperature coefficient of resistance. Alpha represents the change in resistance per degree centigrade change in temperature. 

•	Procedure

1.	Select the temperature for which you want to observe the output voltage. 
2.	The temperature can be selected using the slider input.
3.	Click the run button and then use the slider to select any temperature.
4.	The output voltage will be displayed on the numeric indicator.

•	Result\\

The output voltage according to the temperature is obtained. Thus, we can understand the effect of temperature on the RTD which brings about the change in output voltage.




*7.Experiment 7*\\

•	Problem statement
(  Electric Field Coupling)


•	Theory\\
The circuit below gives us basic idea of how interference is coupled electrically to a system. The System A generates a variable output which passes through the load. This signal passes through a portion of the circuit that is parallel to a circuit that supplies the input to System B. The air separating the two circuits acts as the dielectric between two conductors. Thus, this capacitor CC provides a linkage between the two circuits and transfers charge from System A to B. This current is added to the current generated by the supply voltage VS which is given as input to System B. This results in the output of System B to consist of unwanted components in addition to the actual output. This effect is greater when the two circuits are closer and reduces as the distance between them increases. The amount of noise also depends on the frequency and amplitude of the current IL.

Typical value of  CC between two parallel insulated wires  0.1 inch apart is about 50 pF.
 The permittivity of the air as a function of the relative humidity can be calculated from the empirical relation
 
 [[EIL pics/pic 8.png]]
where ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum, T is the absolute temperature (K), RH is the relative humidity (%), P (mm Hg) is the pressure of the air, and PS (mm Hg) is the pressure of saturated water vapor at the temperature T.

*8.Experiment  8*\\

•	Problem statement
(Magnetic Field Coupling)

•	Theory\\
The circuit below gives us basic idea of how interference is coupled magnetically to a system. The System A generates a variable output which passes through the load. This signal passes through a portion of the circuit that is parallel to a circuit that supplies the input to System B. As we know, a current flowing through a conductor creates a magnetic field surrounding it. Thus, this field is coupled to the second circuit essentially behaving like two parallel inductors. This coupled magnetic field induces a voltage in series with the supply voltage VS which is given as input to System B. This results in the output of System B to consist of unwanted components in addition to the actual output. This effect is greater when the two circuits are closer and reduces as the distance between them increases. The amount of noise also depends on the frequency and amplitude of the current IL.

 [[EIL pics/pic 10.png]]\\
The induced voltage VN = - M dIL/dt, where M is the mutual inductance.
Typical value of M between two short insulated wires loomed together is about 0.1 to 3 µH.

   [[EIL pics/pic 11.png]]
 

Sinusoidal magnetic field of flux density B and frequency ω will induce VN with magnitude of j ω A B cos θ, where A is the area of the loop and B cuts area at an angle of θ.
